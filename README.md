# üè´ CampusPulse

**CampusPulse** is a desktop application built in **2024** using **C#** and **Windows Forms**.  
It simulates a lightweight **campus management system** to organize students, mentors, groups, cohorts, teaching sessions, and enrollments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This project was built **entirely from scratch** as part of my early programming training.  
- No external frameworks like Guna UI or Bunifu were used.  
- **UI design is handcrafted**, relying on **images** for visual feedback and styling.
- The app is **not responsive** (fixed screen dimensions), focusing instead on **manual practice** and deep learning.
- **Data is stored in local `.txt` files** instead of databases to simulate simple file-based backends.

## üß† Purpose

CampusPulse reflects my **learning phase in 2024**, during which I challenged myself to build a non-trivial system using core Windows Forms capabilities without relying on ready-made UI kits.
